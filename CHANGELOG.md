# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Critical
- **IOHIDEventSystemClient activation restored**: The C bridging header (IOHIDPublic.h) must declare `IOHIDEventSystemClientCreate` (full client). Using `IOHIDEventSystemClientCreateSimpleClient` silently fails to activate the SPU accelerometer — the sensor opens but delivers no reports. The full client is required to set ReportInterval on hardware services.

### Added
- ImpactTier enum (Tap/Light/Medium/Firm/Hard) with tier display in menu footer
- DetectionConfig struct for atomic configuration of detection parameters
- AudioResponder and FlashResponder protocols for dependency injection
- SensorID type-safe identifier newtype
- NSScreen.displayID extension replacing duplicated NSDeviceDescriptionKey usage
- AccordionCard and SettingHeader reusable UI components
- Per-setting SF Symbol icons with tappable inline help
- Collapsible Device Settings and Sensitivity Settings panels
- Crest factor gate with background RMS tracking (1-second EMA)
- Privacy policy (PRIVACY.md) and PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy manifest
- App Sandbox with device.usb entitlement for Mac App Store
- All user-facing strings wrapped in NSLocalizedString

### Changed
- Accelerometer: IOHIDEventSystemClient activation + IOHIDManager reading (public IOKit API)
- Detection: 4-algorithm voting → 6-gate pipeline (bandpass, spike, rise rate, crest factor, confirmations, rearm)
- Sensitivity renamed to Reactivity with inverted mapping (higher = more reactive)
- Assets loaded from sounds/ and faces/ folders recursively by extension
- Sound selection: pre-sorted by duration at startup, intensity maps to clip length
- ImpactController split into detect() → respond() with DetectedImpact struct
- Debounce merged with rearm into single Cooldown control
- SensorFusionEngine renamed to ImpactFusionEngine
- Frequency band: configurable bandpass (HP 20Hz + LP 25Hz default)
- All detection parameters exposed as user-configurable advanced settings
- Entitlements consolidated to single file (Yamete.entitlements)
- Makefile: hardened runtime, proper process kill cycle, release target cleanup
- Config push to detection engine cached (only on change, not per sample)
- HID thread init: DispatchSemaphore replaces spinlock
- LogStore graceful fallback when Application Support unavailable

### Fixed
- @MainActor isolation on ImpactFusionEngine (was unconfined)
- ScreenFlash hide Task missing @MainActor (AppKit thread safety)
- Updater Tasks missing @MainActor (state mutation isolation)
- EventContext use-after-free on stream termination
- Force unwraps in AccelerometerReader run loop and mode resolution
- Rise rate gate checking instantaneous value instead of window peak
- Settings schema reset wiping all user preferences on every default change

### Removed
- ImpactDetector, SignalDetectors, DetectorConfig (replaced by ImpactFusionEngine)
- Self-updater (updates via Mac App Store)
- Licensing infrastructure (LicenseManager, LicenseStore, trial period)
- Schema version reset mechanism (UserDefaults.register handles new keys)
- Yamete-hardened.entitlements (consolidated into Yamete.entitlements)
- Prefix-based asset naming requirement (sound_*, face_*)
- Unused SliderRow view component and AudioDeviceUID type

## [0.0.0] - 2026-04-02
